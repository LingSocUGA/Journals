  Dear \rule{3cm}{0.4pt},

  Thank you for agreeing to take part in my linguistic study entitled \rule{3cm}{0.4pt}.
  I truly appreciate you taking the time to talk to me.
  I would like to set up a time to have the interview that is convenient for you.
  Please let me know at your earliest convenience when you would like to meet as well as where you would like to meet.
