  \begin{abstract}
    This is the template for a submission to the UGA Working Papers in Linguistics or the LCUGA Conference Proceedings.
    Your submission should have an abstract and it should go here.
    Try to keep the abstract to about 100 words.
  \end{abstract}

  \section{One of your sections}
    Text for your section goes here.
    \subsection{One of your subsections}
      You can also have subsections like this.

  \section{Basic formatting}
    The document itself should have the following formatting options:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Submit either LaTeX, Word, or LibreOffice formats
      \item Charis SIL for the font
      \item 12pt font size
      \item Letter paper size (8.5in by 11in)
      \item 1.25in margins
      \item Use APA standards for citations and work cited that looks like this \parencite[p.~100]{gudmestad_variationist_2022}
    \end{itemize}

    Cross-references and links should be in blue.
    For example, your cross-reference for the table below should be Table \ref{tab:example}, or a web site link might be \href{https://linguistics.uga.edu}{UGA Linguistics} (\url{https://linguistics.uga.edu}).
    Orthographic forms should be \orth{in chevrons}.
    Lexical items should be \lexi{italicized}.
    Glosses should be \gloss{surrounded by single quotes}.
    Grammatical categories should be \cat{in small caps}.\footnote{
      You should use footnotes like this instead of endnotes.
    }
    Computer code should be \code{in a monospaced font}.
    Foreign words should be \foreign{italicized}.
    If you need to use Hangul, it should be written using the Batang font: \foreign{e.g.}, {\hangul 온다}.
    Translations of large amounts of text should go \longtrans{in between square brackets} as opposed to using \gloss{single quotes as you would with glosses}.

    \begin{table}[tbhp]
      \begin{center}
        \caption{Here is the table's caption}
        \label{tab:example}
        Tables should be placed in floats like this one.
        They should preferably be at the top or bottom of a page but can otherwise be on their own page or simply where needed.
      \end{center}
    \end{table}

    \begin{figure}[tbhp]
      \begin{center}
        \caption{Here is the figure's caption}
        \label{tab:example}
        Figures should be just like tables but numbered separately.
      \end{center}
    \end{figure}

    For example sentences (\foreign{e.g.}, if you are submitting a syntax paper), make sure the number is also separate from tables and figures.
    You may use whichever means you like to format these sentences.
    Finally, your works cited should go at the end of the document.

  \printbibliography % Your works cited should go at the end
