# Contents

This folder is for both templates for Linguistics Society at UGA (LSUGA) journals and scripts for automatically converting submissions into quasi-acceptable formats. These journals use the Charis SIL font, which can be downloaded at [https://software.sil.org/charis/](https://software.sil.org/charis/) if you do not already have it.

For those using LaTeX, you need the following files:
* template.tex
* references.bib
* Those in the ./shared/ folder

For those using Word, you need the following files:
* template.dotx

For those using LibreOffice, you need the following files:
* template.ott

If you are using Word or LibreOffice, the templates contain page, paragraph, and character styles. Using them will make the submissions process much smoother.
